# earth-snow-fire

This is the first JavaScript project that I will be completing while working through The Odin Project's cirriculum. In this project I will be utilizing the following skills:

- Planning and 'whiteboarding' to get an idea of what the entire project will consist of
- Pseudocoding (a LOT of comments) to keep track of each section
- Understanding how to use functions/return statements
- Using arrays and selecting random elements from within them
- Using conditionals (if else statement)
- Using for loops so that the game can last until either user or CPU wins 5 rounds total
- Utilizing the console in Chrome to check my code
