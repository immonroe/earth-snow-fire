# rock-paper-scissors

This is the first JavaScript project that I will be completing while working through The Odin Project's cirriculum. In this project I will be utilizing the following skills:

- Planning and 'whiteboarding' to get an idea of what the entire project will consist of
- Pseudocoding (a LOT of comments) to keep track of each section
- Understanding how to use functions/return statements
- Using arrays and selecting random elements from within them
- Using conditionals (if else statement)
- Using for loops so that the game can last until either user or CPU wins 5 rounds total
- Utilizing the console in Chrome to check my code

This is the first time I was legitimately stuck on a project throughout this course. I was confused on what to Google, had issue finding out where to start, how should I break the project to bite-sized pieces, and how to fix things that I broke while trying to add to the project. It took me days of researching via stackoverflow, Google, The Odin Project discord, etc. to even get an idea of what to do next. I had to refer to my previous course (Colt Steele's web dev bootcamp) to review my old notes on some JavaScript basics on functions to refresh my memory on certain topics (scope, arrays, etc.). This project took days to finish, I had to take some extended breaks just to give my brain some time to breath so I wasn't too overwhelmed. Funnily enough, I figured out how to basically write the skeleton of the final part while I was on vacation. It just hit me and I was able to implement it with some Google searching. The hardest part for me was figuring out how to get the for-loop to keep playing rounds of the game while keeping score and ending the game once either the user or CPU reaching 5 total points. 

UPDATE: Returned to this project and updated/re-factored the code using DOM. Here are a few things I learned throughout this project:

- Setting up a branch on a previous project so that it can be worked on without affecting the main branch (can cause merging conflicts)
- Targeting nodes with selectors
- using querySelector/querySelectorAll to highlight a selector or full nodelist
- Creating elements from DOM
- append/removing/modifying elements from DOM(JavaScript)
- Utilizing/understanding DOM events
- Attatching listeners to group(s) of nodes
